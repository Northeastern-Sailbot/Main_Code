Sails
-The boat can't go directly into the wind (Irons)
-The boat shouldn't go directly away from the wind either. This is
because there's a high risk of capsizing when the sails are all the way out.
-To stay still, point the bow upwind and let the sails all the way out.

-Turning upwind is called "heading up." When doing so, the main sail is adjusted first,
followed by the jib.
-Turning downwind is called "bearing off." When doing so, the jib is adjusted first,
followed by the main sail.

Rudder
-The rudder should be used sparingly when sailing downwind or jibing.
-One the other hand, a hard turn is necessary to carry the boat's momentum through
a tack.
-When sailing near irons, the bow will be pulled slightly towards the wind. The rudder
must compensate for this.
